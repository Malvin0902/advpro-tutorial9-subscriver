## a. What is AMQP?

**AMQP** stands for **Advanced Message Queuing Protocol**. It is a way for different parts of a program (or different programs) to send messages to each other. It helps systems talk to each other using messages, often through a message broker like **RabbitMQ**.

AMQP is useful because:

* It allows sending and receiving messages without both sides needing to be active at the same time.
* It supports queues to hold messages until they are processed.
* It helps make systems more reliable and easier to scale.

## b. What does `guest:guest@localhost:5672` mean?

This is a way to connect to an AMQP server. Hereâ€™s what each part means:

* `guest` (first): the **username**
* `guest` (second): the **password**
* `localhost`: the **address** of the server (in this case, your own computer)
* `5672`: the **port number** RabbitMQ uses for AMQP connections

So this means:

> "Connect to the RabbitMQ server running on my computer (localhost), using the username `guest` and password `guest`, on port 5672."
